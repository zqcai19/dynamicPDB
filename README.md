## Overview

**Dynamic PDB** is a large-scale dataset that enhances existing prestigious static 3D protein structural databases, such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB), by integrating dynamic data and additional physical properties. It contains approximately 12.6k filtered proteins, each subjected to all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to capture conformational changes.

Compared with previously existing protein MD datasets, dynamic PDB provides three key advancements:

1. **`Extended simulation durations`**: Up to 1 microsecond per protein, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of significant conformational changes.
2. **`Finer-grained sampling intervals`**: 1 picosecond intervals, allowing for the capture of more detailed allosteric pathways.
3. **`Enriched array of physical properties`**: Captured during the MD process, including atomic velocities and forces, potential/kinetic energies, and the temperature of the simulation environment, etc.

## What dynamic PDB contains?

The attributes contained in dynamic PDB are listed as follows:

| File Name | Attribute | Data Type | Unit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `{protein_id}_T.pkl` | Trajectory coordinates | float array | Å |
| `{protein_id}_V.pkl` | Atomic velocities | float array | Å/ps |
| `{protein_id}_F.pkl` | Atomic forces | float array | kcal/mol·Å |
| `{protein_id}_npt_sim.dat` | Potential energy<br>Kinetic energy<br>Total energy<br>Temperature<br>Box volume<br>System density | float<br>float<br>float<br>float<br>float<br>float | kJ/mole<br>kJ/mole<br>kJ/mole<br>K<br>nm³<br>g/mL |

In addition, the following data are stored during the MD simulation:

| File Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{protein_id}_minimized.pdb` | PDB structure after minimization |
| `{protein_id}_nvt_equi.dat` | Information in NVT equilibration |
| `{protein_id}_npt_equi.dat` | Information in NPT equilibration |
| `{protein_id}_T.dcd` | DCD format for trajectory coordinates |
| `{protein_id}_state_npt1000000.0.xml` | Status file for MD prolongation |

## Data Availability Notice

Thank you for your interest and support in our dataset. Due to the immense size of the full simulation data and storage limitations, we have decided to provide the 100ns simulation data for all proteins for online download, with detailed usage instructions provided below ([Download Dataset](#download-dataset)). For researchers who require the 1µs simulation data for specific proteins, please fill out an agreement to the [dynamicPDB Terms of Use](assets/dynamicPDB_Terms_of_Use.pdf), using your institutional email addresses, and send it to us at caizhiqiang@sais.com.cn, along with the PDB IDs. We will provide the data individually. The full list of PDB IDs can be downloaded [here](assets/PDB_ID.csv).

## Download Dataset

You can easily get dynamic PDB dataset from our [ModelScope repo](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/fudan-generative-vision/dynamicPDB/).

1. Make sure you have Git LFS installed:
```shell
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
# Initialize Git LFS
git lfs install
```

2. Navigate to your `DATA_ROOT` and clone the source:

```shell
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/fudan-generative-vision/dynamicPDB.git dynamicPDB_raw
```
`GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1` configures Git to clone the pointers for all LFS files.

3. Download data with a specific `protein_id`, for example `1a62_A`:

```shell
cd dynamicPDB_raw
git lfs pull --include="{protein_id}/*"
```

4. Merge the split-volume compression into one file and then unzip the `.tar.gz` file:

```shell
cat {protein_id}/{protein_id}.tar.gz.part* > {protein_id}/{protein_id}.tar.gz
cd ${Your Storage Root}
mkdir dynamicPDB  # ignore if directory exists
tar -xvzf dynamicPDB_raw/{protein_id}/{protein_id}.tar.gz -C dynamicPDB
```

Finally, the dataset should be organized as follows:

```text
./dynamicPDB/
|-- 1a62_A_npt100000.0_ts0.001
|   |-- 1a62_A_npt_sim_data
|   |   |-- 1a62_A_npt_sim_0.dat
|   |   `-- ...
|   |-- 1a62_A_dcd
|   |   |-- 1a62_A_dcd_0.dcd
|   |   `-- ...
|   |-- 1a62_A_T
|   |   |-- 1a62_A_T_0.pkl
|   |   `-- ...
|   |-- 1a62_A_F
|   |   |-- 1a62_A_F_0.pkl
|   |   `-- ...
|   |-- 1a62_A_V
|   |   |-- 1a62_A_V_0.pkl
|   |   `-- ...
|   |-- 1a62_A.pdb
|   |-- 1a62_A_minimized.pdb
|   |-- 1a62_A_nvt_equi.dat
|   |-- 1a62_A_npt_equi.dat
|   |-- 1a62_A_T.dcd
|   |-- 1a62_A_T.pkl
|   |-- 1a62_A_F.pkl
|   |-- 1a62_A_V.pkl
|   `-- 1a62_A_state_npt100000.0.xml
|-- 1ah7_A_npt100000.0_ts0.001
|   |-- ...
|   `-- ...
`-- ...
```

For ease of use, we have also provided segmented versions of the data (directories `{protein_id}_dcd`, `{protein_id}_T`, `{protein_id}_F`, and `{protein_id}_V`), each representing one-tenth of the total simulation duration, sequentially named from 0 to 9 in chronological order. The files `{protein_id}_T.dcd`, `{protein_id}_T.pkl`, `{protein_id}_F.pkl`, `{protein_id}_V.pkl` are their corresponding combination.

## Applications
1. [Physics condition](./applications/physics_condition/): we extend the SE(3) diffusion model to incorporate sequence features and physical properties for the task of trajectory prediction.
2. [4D diffusion](./applications/4d_diffusion/): we introduce a 4D diffusion with motion alignment  to learn dynamic protein structures.
3. [Conformation sampling](./applications/conformation_sampling/): we introduce a 4D diffusion to sample diverse protein conformations.
